# Project Brief

The **Emitters Website** repository is a multi-faceted ecosystem that serves as both the central hub for the "Emitters - Drone Invasion" survival FPS and a sophisticated workspace for developer and quantitative tools.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Game Hub & Marketing
The primary landing page for the Emitters universe, handling marketing, story delivery, and community redirection.

### 2. Quantitative Trading Suite
Advanced financial tools for strategy development and performance analysis.
- **Backtesting Tool**: Custom SciChart-based simulation engine for market data analysis.
- **PNL Calendar**: Detailed tracking of trading results and performance metrics over time.

### 3. AI & Voice Innovation
Cutting-edge integrations of Large Language Models and voice synthesis.
- **AI Assistants**: Voice-activated, 3D-visualized systems (PC and TikTok variants).
- **MemoGPT**: Intelligent prompt and memo management system.

### 4. 3D Engineering & Visualization
Technical tools for hardware monitoring, design, and data representation.
- **Engineering Tools**: 3D CAD applications, G-code timelapse visualizers, and multi-camera 3D printer monitors.
- **Data Visualizer**: Immersive 3D point-cloud representations of complex datasets.

### 5. Creative Multimedia
Real-time audio-visual experiences and interactive detectors.
- **Multimedia**: Audio-reactive visualizers (Sounder) and AI-powered camera pose effects.
- **Simulation**: Industrial-style EMF detectors driven by network latency.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main logical parts:
- **Main Portal**: Static landing pages and core landing infrastructure.
- **App Ecosystem**: A specialized Next.js environment (`node-projects/my-app/`) hosting the majority of the interactive tools.
