# Project Brief

The **Emitters Website** is the central hub for the game "Emitters - Drone Invasion", a survival FPS. It serves two main purposes:
1. **Marketing & Landing Page**: Promoting the game, its story, features, and linking to store pages (Steam, Ultra).
2. **Developer Tools**: Hosting internal tools, primarily the **Backtesting App** (`tools/index6.html`), used to simulate and refine trading strategies against historical market data.

## Core Components
- **Main Website**: `index.html` and associated assets.
- **Backtesting Tool**: `tools/index6.html` (and `index6.js`, `index6.css`).
